# Device Information

## About

This directory contains useful information for debugging devices that the
project developers might not have access to.

## Structure

The information is organized in subdirectories with the following structure:

```
device-info
└── <device-name>+<bridge-vendor>-<bridge-model>
    ├── media-ctl-topology.txt
    └── urls.txt
```

For example, information about a Raspberry Pi 5 featuring a GeekWorm C779 HDIM
to CSI-2 bridge would be stored in `raspberrypi5+geekworm-c779`.

To generate it, run:
