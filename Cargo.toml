# It's a bit of a hack, but we can't run cargo deb within cross until cross
# allows us to:
# https://github.com/cross-rs/cross/issues/716
#
# Since we're not running it within the container, the host libraries are used
# by cargo-deb and it will pick the host C library as a dependency, even though
# it might have been built with something else entirely.
#
# Let's force the current container C library version.
